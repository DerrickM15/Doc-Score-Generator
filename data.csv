A detailed explanation of the Issue/Request:
This account has 720 devices and a number of units have a low battery reading and stopped tracking. He is tracking construction equipment like boom lifts and scissors lifts. I actually received an email about this account in the past and sent info on what they were tracking. However, I never received more information. I attached the email for reference as well. Please reach out to Nick to assist. Thank you.

-------------- TROUBLESHOOTING -------------------
Is fast-track enabled for these units?
Was the magnet fully removed from the units during installation?
Are the units next to a magnet?


To do: 
Request to Cameron to send and update to the script on all units currently on ""Firmware  29C  Script Identifier  7.101"".

Cameron mentioned the units are on the right script but the issue could be with the network. At this point reset won't work with these units and he recommended RMA.

Yes, there’s nothing for us to do.

Of course, the ping test URL (https://billingintegrationapi.vfmwe.uk/WebApi/V1/NotificationService/notify2) is not working anymore because we migrated all Maxis companies from AppDirect and the AppDirect integration is turned off. AppDirect should do the same – remove the Actsoft app from their platform and stop trying to access the obsolete endpoints.

Question: Is there a way to configure a user in Workforce Manager to be ""dispatchable"" via the dispatch module, but not have any login information or license? This would serve as a visual/organization tool for our Dispatcher and not need to be accessed by mobile users. I realize I could possibly create a new service type for this scenario, but it would be smoother workflow-wise to have these unlicensed, ""fake"" users.

A detailed explanation of the Issue/Request: Tried a soft reset, and the customer still has issues.

Hey, there Steve,
 Thank you for your help today! The issue with the tech not tracking is continuing even after he's unplugged and reconnected the device on 4 different attempts. All were unsuccessful. He is just getting blue blinking and at one point got a yellow/orange color as well. If we could open a tech support ticket on that, that would be greatly appreciated so we can have this tech tracking again.

Please direct this mail to the respective PIC. 

 

Guess that you’ve already changed the config at the backend for all the appdirect users.

Would like to request: If possible, the users supposed to login both ways, either via appdirect or mWFM directly.

 

If you cant allow this both option, then the next best solution would be.
Activate all the users on Tuesday (18/7) – Which will be your Monday.

 

However, please allow the users to login via Appdirect as of now.

Thanks!","Greetings Muhammed,

I have coordinated with our development team to investigate the login issues reported.

The rollback option is not currently available as it would result in a loss of 2 day’s worth of client data. 

To resolve the login issue please ensure the customers are using the correct login URL www.mworkforce.biz, and have those users click the forgot password link. This will generate an email to the user’s email address that is associated with their username. They can they reset their password and login. 

 

Thank you,

Brent Baughn

I looked at an older case on the account and it seems she had the same problem in 2022. Her reset password email was getting stuck in her SPAM folder. Not sure if this is the problem now or not but it’s a starting point.

Can someone please reach out to Diane to assist her with getting logged into her account ASAP?",Customer requested to speak with CX because she wasn't aware ATT WFM was a product of Actsoft. She mentioned she didn't authorize the switch. Emailed to Johanna to get someone to call back Diane. Provided Diane with a solution for the email report issue but she was more interested to speak with CX.

If you have 2 clients that have a client reference number, delete the reference number for the first client (this will be fine), but deleting it from the second client will throw the error. I just checked on WFM and it all works correctly, but somehow Encore might be saving the deleted reference number as empty string instead of null, which is causing the next empty string to throw a duplicate error message.

 

I had 2 clients with reference numbers and deleted one of them

 

Here’s what the API results look like on the backend –

 

The ExternalId should not be empty string (“”), it should be null if the reference number is deleted. On WFM, a deleted reference number shows as null on this property. Only Encore is affected.

Customer is creating a new client and using the address lookup text box, however when they select an address from the list, the first option always populates in the address fields.

Use S9 3XW as the postal code in the search bar after selecting UK as the country, and multiple addresses will be available to select –

Select “9 Washford Road, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, S9 3XW” as the address (4th address down)
The address that populates ends up being the first item from the list, not the one selected
